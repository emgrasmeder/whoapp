    script_downloader.py makes quick use of Python's webscraping abilities
    to downlaod all the Doctor Who scripts to my local computer.

    Script source: http://www.chakoteya.net/doctorwho/index.htm
    Initially, I am agnostic to the accuracy and completeness of these
    scripts. I consider deviations from the official script to be normally
    distributed and therefore won't interfere with the integrity of this
    vital, vital research.

    The script is written in python2.7, until I know that all the dependencies
    will work with python3
